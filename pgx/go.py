            NOTE: For the final dimension, there are two possible options:

              - Use the color of current player to play
              - Use the color of `player_id`

            This ambiguity happens because `observe` function is available even if state.current_player != player_id.
            In the AlphaGo Zero paper, the final dimension C is explained as:

              > The final feature plane, C, represents the colour to play, and has a constant value of either 1 if black
        is to play or 0 if white is to play.

            however, it also describes as

              > the colour feature C is necessary because the komi is not observable.

            So, we use player_id's color to let the agent komi information.
            As long as it's called when state.current_player == player_id, this doesn't matter.
