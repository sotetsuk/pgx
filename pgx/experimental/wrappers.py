    """Auto reset wrapper.

    We have a concern about the final state before staging this wrapper:

    When auto-reset happens, the termianl (or truncated) state/observation is
    replaced by initial state/observation, It's ok if it's termination.
    However, when truncation happens, value of truncated state/observation
    might be used by agents (by bootstrap). So it must be stored somewhere.
    For example,

    https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium/blob/main/gymnasium/wrappers/autoreset.py#L59

    However, currently, truncation does *NOT* actually happens because
    all of Pgx environments (games) are finite-horizon and
    terminates within reasonable # of steps.
    Note that chess, shogi, and Go have `max_termination_steps` as AlphaZero.
    So, this implementation is enough (so far).
