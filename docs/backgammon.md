## Observation

The first `28` observation dimensions follow `[Antonoglou+22]`:

> In our backgammon experiments, the board was represented using a vector of size 28, with the first
24 positions representing the number of chips for each player in the 24 possible points on the board,
and the last four representing the number of hit chips and born off chips for each of the two players.
We used positive numbers for the current playerâ€™s chips and negative ones for her opponent.
