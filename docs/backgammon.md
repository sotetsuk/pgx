## Observation

The first `28` observation dimensions follow `[Antonoglou+22]`:

> An action in our implementation consists of 4 micro-actions, the same as the maximum number
of dice a player can play at each turn. Each micro-action encodes the source position of a chip
along with the value of the die used. We consider 26 possible source positions, with the 0-th position corresponding to a no-op, the 1st to retrieving a chip from the hit pile, and the remaining to selecting a chip in one of the 24 possible points. Each micro-action is encoded as a single integer with micro-action = `src Â· 6 + die`.
