## Usage

```py
import pgx

env = pgx.make("gardner_chess")
```

or you can directly load `GardnerChess` class

```py
from pgx.gardner_chess import GardnerChess

env = GardnerChess()
```

## Description

> A board needs to be five squares wide to contain all kinds of chess pieces on the first row. In 1969, Martin Gardner suggested a chess variant on 5Ã—5 board in which all chess moves, including pawn double-move, en-passant capture as well as castling can be made. Later AISE (Associazione Italiana Scacchi Eterodossi, "Italian Heterodox Chess Association") abandoned pawn double-move and castling. The game was largely played in Italy (including by correspondence) and opening theory was developed.

Pgx implementation does not support pawn double-move, en-passant and castling.

## Specs

| Name | Value |
|:---|:----:|
| Version | `v0` |
| Number of players | `2` |
| Number of actions | `1225` |
| Observation shape | `(5, 5, 115)` |
| Observation type | `float` |
| Rewards | `{-1, 0, 1}` |

## Observation
We follow the observation design of AlphaZero `[Silver+18]`.
P1 denotes the current player, and P2 denotes the opponent.

| Index | Description |
|:---:|:----|
| `[:, :, 0:6]` | P1 board @ 0-steps before |
| `[:, :, 6:12]` | P2 board @ 0-steps before |
| `[:, :, 12:14]` | Repetitions @ 0-steps before |
| ... | (@ 1-7 steps before) |
| `[:, :, 112]` | Color | 
| `[:, :, 113]` | Total move count | 
| `[:, :, 114]` | No progress count | 

## Action
We also follow the action design of AlphaZero `[Silver+18]`.
There are `1225 = 25 x 49` possible actions.
Each action represents

- 25 source position (`action // 49`), and
- 49 moves (`action % 49`)

Moves are defined by 32 queen moves, 8 knight moves, and 9 underpromotions.

## Rewards
Non-zero rewards are given only at the terminal states.
The reward at terminal state is described in this table:

| | Reward |
|:---|:----:|
| Win | `+1` |
| Lose | `-1` |
| Draw | `0` |

## Termination

Termination occurs when one of the following conditions are satisfied:

1. checkmate
2. stalemate
3. no sufficient pieces to checkmate
4. threefold repetition
5. `50` halfmoves are elapsed without any captures or pawn moves
6. `256` steps are elapsed (`512` in full-size chess experiments in AlphaZero `[Silver+18]`)


## Version History

- `v0` : Initial release (v1.0.0)

## Baseline models

Pgx offers a baseline model for Gardner Chess. Users can use it for an anchor opponent in evaluation.
See [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17503) for more details. See [this colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sotetsuk/pgx/blob/main/colab/baselines.ipynb) for how to use it.

| Model ID | Description |
