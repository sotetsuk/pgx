## Specs

| Name | Value |
|:---|:----:|
| Version | `v0` |
| Number of players | `1` |
| Number of actions | `4` |
| Observation shape | `(4, 4, 31)` |
| Observation type | `bool` |
| Rewards | `{0, 2, 4, ...}` |

## Observation

Our obseervation design basically follows `[Antonoglou+22]`:

> In our 2048 experiments we used a binary representation of the observation as an input to our model.
Specifically, the 4 Ã— 4 board was flattened into a single vector of size 16, and a binary representation
of 31 bits for each number was obtained, for a total size of 496 numbers.

However, instaead of `496`-d flat vector, we employ `(4, 4, 31)` vector. 


| Index | Description |
|:---:|:----|
| `[i, j, b]` | represents that square `(i, j)` has a tile of `2 ^ b` if `b > 0` |

## Action
Each action corresnponds to `0 (left)`, `1 (up)`, `2 (right)`, `3 (down)`.

## Rewards
Sum of merged tiles.

## Termination
If all squares are filled with tiles and no legal actions are available, the game terminates.
